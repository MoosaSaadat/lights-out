## Lights Out

Ever heard of the phrase **Easy to Learn, Hard to Master**?
Yes, this game is the same. It is a relatively simple game to play but too difficult to WIN.

### How to Play?

Click on the lights to switch them on and off. When you click on a light, it toggles its state along with four other lights (top, bottom, left, right).

### How to Win?

Ehhh... Winning at this game is as rare as a unicorn but still you can try by switching off all the lights on the board. Once, the board is completely dark (all lights switched off), you will be greeted by a 'Congratulations' message!
